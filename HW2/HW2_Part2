Assignment 2 Part 2
 
Question 1:
For the code provided, the default list in the function, lst, is given
a space in memory when the function, func, is run without a parameter. 
Because of this, when func is called multiple times, it will append the 
the list that was created during the first run. Ocer time, if run too much
this can cause major problems with memory space which could probably crash
the computer. To prevent this one could avoid defining functions in which 
the parameter passed is permanent rather than temporary and constantly update
python as new versions become available. 

Question 2:
Lambda functions are syntactically limited to single expression, meaning they
can only handle single basic functionalities.
