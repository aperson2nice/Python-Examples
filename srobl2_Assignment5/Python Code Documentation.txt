----TestBankCreator.py----
This code will work okay to create a workable CSV. 

Known Problems:
 -There is currently no test to see if the user is inputting the
  correct values once their in the question portions of input
 -The solution types could be refined so it will only accept a, b, c, d, etc.
  as solutions for multiple choice, T or F as solutions for the True and False
  questions, and provide a possible solution rather than an exact one for the 
  open ended. This will make "grading" the quizzes easier.


----QuizCreator.py----
Information is stored fine

Known Problems: 
 -Input types for the answers could be restristricted to a,b,c,d etc as noted
  above. 
 -Once all the data is inputted, it could be displayed with an autograde feature
  that will show how many questions user got right and wrong
